#🚀 PROXY.BOT 🚀

📄 OVERVIEW

This is a SIMPLE PYTHON SCRIPT designed to utilize PROXY SERVERS for sending DATA PACKETS (BYTES) to a specified IP ADDRESS and PORT.

The script demonstrates BASIC NETWORKING CONCEPTS, particularly the use of proxies to RELAY INFORMATION between a client and a target server. This can be useful for:

Testing network configurations

Simulating traffic for performance analysis

Educational purposes related to network security and proxy usage

⚙️ HOW IT WORKS

The script operates by:
1️⃣ Accepting user-defined inputs for the target IP address and port.
2️⃣ Using a list of proxy servers to route the outgoing data.
3️⃣ Sending data packets (bytes) through these proxies to the designated destination.

This approach helps in DISTRIBUTING NETWORK REQUESTS through multiple proxies, which can be useful for LOAD TESTING or studying how proxies handle data routing.
